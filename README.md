# OpenCV Bootcamp Exercise

Welcome to the OpenCV Bootcamp Exercise repository! This repository contains various exercises and examples that helped me to get started with OpenCV and computer vision. All the credits go to the free opencv bootcamp course available in opencv.org

## Introduction

This repository is all about my practices with OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, I hope these exercises will help you improve your skills and understanding of computer vision concepts.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Getting into Images
- Reading an image
- Check image attributes like datatype and shape
- Matrix representation of an image in Numpy
- Color Images and splitting/merging image channels
- Displaying images using matplotlib
- Saving images

### Exercise 2: Basic Images manipulation
- Accessing and manipulating images pixels
- Image resizing
- Cropping
- Flipping

### Exercise 3: Annotating Images
   - Draw lines
   - Draw circles
   - Draw rectangles
   - Add text

### Exercised 4: Image Enhancement
  - Arithmetic Operations like addition, multiplication
  - Thresholding & Masking
  - Bitwise Operations like OR, AND, XOR

### Exercise 5: Accessing and Writing Video
   - used cv2.VideoWriter() object to create and write video files
  - explored the fourcc Codec for video

### Exercise 6: Image Filtering (Edge Detection)
   - color grade function on Live feed
   - Box Filtering, Laplacian Filtering

### Exercise 7: Image Alignment
   - Homography transformation of square to arbitrary quad
   - ORB(Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm for key feature extraction

### Exercise 8: Panorama
   - use of cv2.Stitcher_create()
   - deep dive into the working mechanism of cv2.Stitcher_create()
   - exploration of DoG, SIFT, RANSAC algorithms and it's use in creating panorama

### Exercise 9: High Dynamic Range(HDR)
   - creation of HDR using multi light exposured images
   - deep dive into the algorithms like Debevec Callibration Algorithm, Tonemapping

More exercises will be added over time. Stay tuned!

## Accessing `.ipynb` File through Colab

All exercises are provided as Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file which can be easily accessed and run on Google Colab. This makes it convenient to execute the code without needing to set up a local environment.


**Note:** The comments and explanations within the Colab files are well-documented for reference, providing additional context and guidance for each exercise.
